And that\u0026rsquo;s true. But just how bad will it be when running AI on a low-end GPU?\nHow to run LLM and Stable Diffusion on Intel UHD 630 iGPU? Intel has a Pytouch library called IPEX-LLM for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU. However, it doesn’t seem to support my iGPU.\nThe IPEX-LLM requires a graphic driver version of 31.0.101.5122 and higher, which is only compatible with Intel Core 11 gen and newer iGPUs, as well as Intel Arc GPUs. For the Intel UHD 630, the latest driver available is 31.0.101.2130—below the required level.\nLLM Test Run (Llama 3.2 1B Instruct Q8 Llama 3.2 3B Instruct Q8) Let\u0026rsquo;s run some Large Language Model(LLM). I used Jan, a software that support Vulkan, to run open LLMs. I will test run the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct Q8 and Llama 3.2 3B Instruct Q8.\nDownload and install Jan. Go the Settings → Advanced Settings → toggle Experimental Mode → toggle Vulkan Support. Go the Hub, download Llama 3.2 1B Instruct Q8 and Llama 3.2 3B Instruct Q8. Then, we can start using these models. First attempt on iGPU I run the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct Q8 on my iGPU and asked it, \u0026ldquo;List down what you can do for me\u0026rdquo;.\nThe iGPU utilization almost hit 100% while generating the response.\nThe token speed is around 7.7t/s, which is fairly usable.\nSecond attempt on iGPU Next, I switch the model to Llama 3.2 3B Instruct Q8 and run it.\nThe model can't even start—it failed to allocate memory due to insufficient device memory, as noted in the log.\nThe Llama 3.2 3B Instruct Q8 require at least 8GB VRAM. My iGPU only got 4GB shared VRAM. Obviously, I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough RAM to share with my iGPU.\nThrid attempt on CPU Why not try the CPU instead? I toggle off the Vulkan support and run Llama 3.2 1B Instruct Q8 on the CPU.\nCPU utilization is between 80% and 90% during response generation.\nWoW! The token speed is double up to 14.46t/s, which is faster than the iGPU.\nForth attempt on CPU I continue try the Llama 3.2 3B Instruct Q8 on the CPU. This time, the model able to start and generate response.\nCPU utilization close to 100% while generating response.\nThe token speed is about 5.56t/s, which is a bit slow but still usable.\nStable Diffusion Test Run (SD 1.5) To run Stable Diffusion on the iGPU, I use the stable-diffusion.cpp version that supports Vulkan.\nFirst attemps on iGPU I run the Vulkan-supported stable-diffusion.cpp executable with Stable Diffusion 1.5 model and using a simple prompt, \u0026quot;people\u0026quot;, with default settings.\nThe iGPU utilization is around 100%.\nIt takes 551.46s(≈ 9 minutes and 11 seconds) to complete and the speed is 28.09s/it.\nSecond attemps on CPU - AVX2 I then download the CPU AVX2-supported stable-diffusion.cpp. I run it with Stable Diffusion 1.5 model and a simple prompt, \u0026quot;people\u0026quot;. All the settings remain default.\nThe CPU utilization is around 66% only.\nIt take 352.32s(≈ 5 minutes and 52 seconds) to complete with the speed of 16.41s/it.—nearly twice as fast as the iGPU.\nConclusion Thanks to Vulkan, I can play a little bit of AI things on my low-end iGPU. However, when looking at token speed or iteration times, the CPU outperforms the iGPU by nearly double, which making almost no sense to use iGPU for AI tasks.\nThe only use case I can imagine is offload some of the workload from the CPU . For example, if I\u0026rsquo;m coding and need a LLM to help debug, I could let the iGPU handle the LLM responses while the CPU focuses on compiling code.\nLastly, it\u0026rsquo;s quite fun to play around AI.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/run-local-llm-stable-diffusion-locally-low-end-hardware/","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s start with my PC spec.\nComponents Parts Processor Intel i5 10400ES iGPU Intel UHD Graphics 630 Motherboard AsRock B460M Pro RAM Adata DDR4-2666 4GB x2 dGPU N/A When it comes to AI, most people probably think it requires a beefy GPU to run smoothly and quickly.

Usually, it\u0026rsquo;s caused by the clogging washing machine\u0026rsquo;s water inlet filter. However, mine one is the water valve faulty. The water valve controls the water flow to decide when to start filling and stop the water. My water valve still functions as it should, but I think it has some blockage, causing the water to flow slowly.\nSo, I fixed it by myself. I spent about RM 15 on the water inlet valve and a whole day to replace it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/fix-washing-machine-water-fill-issue/","summary":"My washing machine has the water fill/water flow slow/water pressure low issue.
