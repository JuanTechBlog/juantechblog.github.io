## The AirPlay 2 feature is a scam at first.
My first hand-on using this speaker is not pleasant and it's feel like a scam. I brought this Xiaomi Smart Speaker Lite in last year, 9 September 2023. The AirPlay 2 feature from this speaker is the main selling point for me. However, It's doesn't work! 

**YES! IT'S DOESN'T WORK!!!!**

After, I found a post talking about this issue in a [forum](https://xiaomi.eu/community/threads/xiaomi-smart-speaker-lite-unable-to-connect-to-airplay.69581/#post-725901). It's look like I'm not alone. So, I join the circle jerk to blame about the "scam". 

Oneday, I received an email about the post update. Someone said that the AirPlay 2 feature works now. I immediately verify it and the info is right. 

## Build Quality




## I don't like Alexa International.

I'm more like a Siri guy, my phone always nearby me. So, I'm not invest in Alexa ecosystem. But here are my thoughts after use it on and off for few months.

Since I live in Malaysia, I can only use the Alexa international version. 

I tried to connect my Alexa-compatible TP-Link Kasa KL110 smart light bulb with Alexa and it doesn't work. Alexa app able to link my TP-Link account together, but it couldn't find my light.

However, my Tuya smart switch able to connect into Alexa and controll it with my voice via Alexa.

Another weird thing is not able to set my device location in Alexa app. So, I have to include "in Malaysia" everytime when I ask Alexa about the weather.

In 5 meter away the speaker, the environment noise is about 45± db and my voice is about 80 db± (decibel meter right in front of me) able to wake the Alexa up.

## Sound quality

I'm not a audiophile 

and I think Xiaomi Smart Speaker Lite has good sound quality.

My first impression of this speaker is that it's good for podcast. The speaker able to deliver clear voice but it's feel just a little bit boxy. 

It's still
