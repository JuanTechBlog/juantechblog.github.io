I built the same monitor riser/stand two years ago. After that, I upgraded to a monitor arm. I gave my monitor riser to my sister.

Not long ago, I bought an IKEA ALEX storage unit to replace one side of my table legs. My tabletop doesn't fit the pre-drilled holes for the ALEX storage unit, so I just placed the tabletop on top of the ALEX storage unit. It's not secure and can move easily.

Therefore, I don't think the monitor arm is safe to use in this setup anymore. I need to built a monitor riser.
