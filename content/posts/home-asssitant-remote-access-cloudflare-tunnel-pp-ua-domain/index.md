## Intro
This is the method that I use for remote access to my Home Assistant.

We take advantage of the free Cloudflare Tunnel feature to connect our local serviceâ€”Home Assistant without expose our external IP.

The diagram below from [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) shows how the Cloudflare Tunnel works:

We will go through the steps to register a domain, switch the domain's nameserver to Cloudflare, set up the Cloudflare Tunnel, install the cloudflared client using Docker Compose, and configure Home Assistant

### :stop_sign: Disclaimer

Before proceed, I think you should know the risk. 

Register a .PP.UA will expose your information when someone look up on the whois record. I recommand to use fake name, home address and temporary email. But they need a functional phone number for verification. We can use a virtual phone number for that. It's quite hard to get a virtual phone number in Malaysia. 

Also, we need to bind our credit/debit card with it. I suggest using a virtual credit/debit card for that.
