My washing machine has the water fill/water flow slow/water pressure low issue. It slows down the washing machine's normal wash cycle from around 1 hour to 3 or 4 hours to complete.

## Water Inlet Valve Issue.

<br/>

Usually, it's caused by the clogging washing machine's water inlet filter. However, mine one is the water valve faulty. The water valve controls the water flow to decide when to start filling and stop the water. My water valve still functions as it should, but I think it has some blockage, causing the water to flow slowly.

So, I fixed it by myself. I spent about RM 15 on the water inlet valve and a whole day to replace it.
